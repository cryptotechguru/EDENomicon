# EDEN Pilot Questionnaire

The purpose of this questionnaire is to capture information about one of the initial peer sites to pilot the EDEN network.

**EDEN: The Ethical Data Exchange Network**

### Vision:
We believe in a future where supply chain data producers are recognized, respected, and rewarded for sharing information and collaborating with one another.

### Mission:
We re-connect decentralized supply-chains with anti-fragile tools that protect data ownership, enable claims certification, and reward product information exchange.

## Pilot Opportunity:

We have an opportunity to use blockchain technology to trace cannabis products along the supply chain. This is done by allowing each supply chain participant to create a digital id and make claims about the product. This is the first step of a multi-step process towards data tokenization.

Notarizing product claims generates multiple benefits:

1. Real-time product traceability
2. Notarizing claims provides digital evidence of IP
3. Terroir, cultivar, location, and other basic information will be captured in the first pilots.

## Questionnaire:

* Name of Organization:
* State or zipcode:

* What is your organization role in the supply chain (tweet-size)?

* Describe your main product (product to be used in pilot) in 250 chars or less (tweet-size):

* What differentiates your product from similar offerings in the industry? (tweet-size)

* What else would you want your customers to know about your product?

* Please list other EDA pilot participants you do business with:
This will allow us to link multiple participants with a product history identifier. For example: a grower sends a batch of product to a lab.

* Do you have supply chain partners you would like to introduce to the EDA and to our network?
